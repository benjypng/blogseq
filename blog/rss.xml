            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A user on Discord asked about an older plugin that allows a user to insert timestamps for their own uploaded videos. This is natively available for embedded YouTube videos, but not uploaded files.</p>
<p>I can't recall what was the older plugin, but given that locally uploaded media files are rendered in HTML, it should be relatively straightforward to derive and set the <code>currentTime</code> through the DOM.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="scaffolding">Scaffolding<a href="https://benjypng.github.io/blogseq/blog/2025/12/02/creating-the-mediaplyer-plugin#scaffolding" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scaffolding" title="Direct link to Scaffolding" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The plugin SDK has been updated to <code>v0.2.8</code>. I've also decided to use <code>npm</code> instead of <code>pnpm</code> for development due to stability purposes.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="approach">Approach<a href="https://benjypng.github.io/blogseq/blog/2025/12/02/creating-the-mediaplyer-plugin#approach" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Approach" title="Direct link to Approach" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>There should be 2 main features for the plugin:</p>
<ol>
<li class="">Inserting timestamps</li>
<li class="">Retrieving timestamps</li>
</ol>
<p>The most straightforward way (in my mind), is to access the DOM, and manipulate the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element directly. For simplicity, the plugin will have to be opinionated in how it inserts timestamps. <strong>Timestamps must be created as child blocks of the parent block where the video was inserted</strong>. The plugin can then simply query the parent block when the user triggers a slach command to insert the timestamp.</p>
<p>After getting the <code>uuid</code> of the parent block, the plugin can use a <code>querySelector</code> to query the element since all blocks in logseq have a <code>div id</code> in the pattern <code>ls-block-&lt;uuid&gt;</code>. From here, it was relatively straightforward to obtain the <code>currentTime</code>.</p>
<p>In order for the user to navigate to a specific time in the video, the user will need to either click on a link or a button. In this case, a link will not be suitable since it is not trivial to use the link to manipulate a DOM element. Hence, I decided to use a button instead. This necessitated the use of <code>onMacroRendererSlotted</code> to render the button and assign a function to it. Once again, this is relatively straightforward with the API, since it allows user-defined values to be passed as function arguments.</p>

<p>The plugin was created quite quickly since the features are straightforward. To try it out, you may download the <a href="https://github.com/benjypng/logseq-mediatimestamp-plugin/releases" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">release</a> and manually load it in Logseq.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="caveat">Caveat<a href="https://benjypng.github.io/blogseq/blog/2025/12/02/creating-the-mediaplyer-plugin#caveat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Caveat" title="Direct link to Caveat" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Publishing plugins to the Logseq marketplace requires defining a <code>manifest.json</code>. For plugins that access the Logseq DOM, instead of just the sandbox iframe, it requires adding <code>effect: true</code>. I am not sure if this is the case still as I have not tried publishing this plugin to the marketplace yet.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[I have been using Logseq DB for the past 2 weeks across 4 devices]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have been using Logseq DB for the past 2 weeks across 4 devices: 2 Macbooks, 1 iPad and 1 iPhone. Below are my findings:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="stability">Stability<a href="https://benjypng.github.io/blogseq/blog/2025/11/28/first-blog-post#stability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Stability" title="Direct link to Stability" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>Sync has been much more stable across my devices, compared to the MD version. Behaviour is more consistent, and my data syncs more reliably. There are occassions where I've had to manually trigger a sync (using the <code>Sync Now</code> button) but other than that, I've not experienced any data loss so far.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="iosipados-app">iOS/iPadOS app<a href="https://benjypng.github.io/blogseq/blog/2025/11/28/first-blog-post#iosipados-app" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to iOS/iPadOS app" title="Direct link to iOS/iPadOS app" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>The rewritten app (on Testflight) actually looks really good. It is much more stable and works more consistently. It is much more feature limited than the browser or the desktop versions, and I like this approach. It is a personal preference though; I don't expect to do full-blown editing on my mobile devices, and don't need the rest of the features. My priority is to be able to capture and retrieve information quickly. Both of which I am able to do now.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="desktop-version">Desktop version<a href="https://benjypng.github.io/blogseq/blog/2025/11/28/first-blog-post#desktop-version" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Desktop version" title="Direct link to Desktop version" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>As I'm actively working on porting over plugins to the DB version, I've been using the desktop app instead of the browser one. Once again, I've not had any problems so far. I keep Logseq open throghout the course of the day, and never faced any data loss issues so far.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="tags-vs-pages">Tags vs Pages<a href="https://benjypng.github.io/blogseq/blog/2025/11/28/first-blog-post#tags-vs-pages" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tags vs Pages" title="Direct link to Tags vs Pages" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>In this area, I admit that I'm still trying to discover the best way to use the new tags. One of the more challenging aspects of using Logseq is that it is not very opinionated on how you should use its features. What I've discovered so far is that tags allow the user to define a consistent set of properties across blocks, but the user needs to determine how this feature can be useful. There are pre-defined tags such as <code>#Journal</code> for journal pages or <code>#Code</code> for code blocks and you can define properties for these tags. For example, if you navigate to the <code>#Code</code> tag page, you will be able to see a list of code blocks, and filter/organise by language. This is really useful personally, as I can quickly find different code snippets I've written before.</p>
<p>Once the DB version is sufficiently propagated, it will be interesting to see how the community fully leverages on this feature for their workflows.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://benjypng.github.io/blogseq/blog/2025/11/28/first-blog-post#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion" translate="no">​</a></h3>
<p>From what I have observed so far, the decision to rewrite the app to use a proper database seems to have its benefits. Users have been frustrated by how long it took, and that communication has not been very consistent. This is in spite of the very <a href="https://github.com/logseq/logseq/commits/master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="">active development</a> made by the dev team.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorTargetStickyNavbar_Vzrq" id="authors-note">Author's Note<a href="https://benjypng.github.io/blogseq/blog/2025/11/28/first-blog-post#authors-note" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Author's Note" title="Direct link to Author's Note" translate="no">​</a></h4>
<p>This is the first post of this blog. I hope to add to the discourse around Logseq as an active user and plugin developer, to provide a more accessible and transparent view of Logseq's progress. I am not a member of the development team.</p>]]></content:encoded>
